                                    A more surprising find was the continued effectiveness of soft drinks’ sports sponsorship during

                                    Shopping behaviour adapted to the lockdown resulting in an increase of online interactions to obtain brand
                                    information and shop for goods. The contribution of digital touchpoints increased by 56%.

                            From a consumer perspective, while the COVID-19 pandemic is transforming the pattern of people’s day-to-day
                            lives, its most profound medium- to long-term impact will be to accelerate key trends that are not new. This will
                            include evolving consumer preferences, changing behaviour patterns and shifting touchpoint relevance and
                            influence.

                            In this article, informed by the latest research, we explore changing touchpoint influence and its effective reach.
                            We also share insights into the impact of the pandemic on channels, using the example of soft drinks.
                            <br><br>
                            We bring rigor to this through consistent “voice-of-the-consumer” based metrics that apply across all touchpoints
                            with brands across all channels. From the perspective of marketing methodology and effectiveness, only by
                            applying consistent metrics across multi-channel touchpoints between brands and consumers can such trends
                            be properly understood and the right responses be made. If you measure in fragments you can only manage in
                            fragments; if you measure holistically you can manage holistically.

                                In order to understand the impact of the pandemic on contacts and brands, we have undertaken a set of studies
                                during the May–June 2020 lockdown in the UK on three non-alcoholic drink categories. We compared the
                                results with the values obtained from our database of recent similar studies developed in European markets
                                (pre-COVID-19).

                                <br />
                                    Whether it is to strengthen sales in the short term or consumer engagement in the medium to long term, the
                                    continuous improvement of communication effectiveness remains one of the biggest challenges for companies in
                                    an environment where change is constant. In the current marketing environment there are:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>an ever more diverse universe of touchpoints;</li>
                                        <li>a better informed, but more sceptical and demanding consumer; and</li>
                                        <li>a constantly changing competitive, social and political context</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    That is without even mentioning the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.  <br><br>
                                    Steering brand strategy, fine tuning execution and optimising budget allocation requires robust insights into the
                                    effective reach of all brand activities, versus competing brands. These insights much be comprehensive,
                                    accurate, representative of real consumer perceptions and regularly updated. In this research, BEPs provide a
                                    universal standard of measurement applicable to any touchpoint and any brand, without restriction in terms of
                                    the category or market.  <br><br>
                                    BEPs quantify how consumers experience brands through contacts, taking into account the content of the
                                    message, the nature of the touchpoint (paid, owned and earned) and the context or the way it is used (a
                                    promotional text, for example, can be targeted to consumers, irrespective of location or when they are standing
                                    in front of the fixture in-store).
                                    <br><br>
                                    <div class="leftImage">

                                    BEPs reflect what consumers perceive, rather than what they receive, and capture the impact of both creativity
                                    and execution. BEPs measure the combined effectiveness of all brand encounters experienced by consumers.
                                    The total brand’s score can then be normalised over the total of the category to calculate the brand experience
                                    share (BES).<br><br>
                                    The BES represents the real outcome of the communication activities achieved by a brand, relative to
                                    competitors. It is a proven early warning indicator of market share changes, correlating with market share
                                    movement to 85% or better.<br><br>
                                    By their very nature, and thanks to the representativeness of the sample used, BEPs allow a multidimensional
                                    analysis of the category: by brand, by touchpoint, by consumer segment, by region, by sales channel, by
                                    product category and by any other criteria. This makes it easy to unveil the ‘must win’ battles across consumer
                                    journeys and align with the strategic choices and immediate tactical actions needed to defend share, build brand
                                    equity and optimise budget allocation.

                                    The horizonal axis in Figure 3 shows the universe of contacts in non-association, i.e. the reach across all
                                    brands. The vertical axis maps the non-alcoholic drinks’ category according to its influence and the highest
                                    values are plotted on the left-hand side. This highlights the power of each touchpoint to differentiate: the lower
                                    the average associations with a touchpoint (i.e. the fewer brands it is associated with), the more it differentiates.

                                    On the upper left cluster, called the ‘Battlefield’, we see contacts that are highly influential but also heavily

                                    the effective reach of TV advertising in the nonalcoholic drinks’ category remained stable between the two periods. We note that the contribution of centennials
                                    (aged 18–24) to the category experience, increased by 15%, thus compensating for the slight reduction

                                    As expected, the effective reach of contacts in hotels, restaurants and cafes showed a significant drop in terms
                                    of both influence and associations. Their contribution to brand experience dropped between 20% and 40%
                                    depending on the touchpoint. Branded decoration and furniture in pubs, cafés and restaurants declined the most
                                    during lockdown.<br><br>
                                    The analysis by sub-category shows that bottled waters and juices suffered the most significant decline: around
                                    60% on average. For the corresponding brands, the loss was two and a half times greater amongst consumers
                                    over the age of 35.<br><br>
                                    On-trade interactions as a whole should gradually regain its essential role in the consumer’s journey in phase
                                    with the resumption of commercial activities in hotels, restaurants and cafés.<br><br>
                                    As the world shifts towards the ‘new normal’, brands need to keep track of how quickly these contacts are
                                    regaining their importance and what has changed. For example, some restaurants are now suggesting that
                                    customers read the menu on their phones by scanning a code, rather than handling a physical menu. This will
                                    impact the way brands can deliver experiences

                                    <h5>Indirect (or physical/analogue-earned contacts)</h5>
                                <br />
                                    While the figures for recommendations from friends, family and colleagues remained stable, we can see a loss of
                                    influence (-12%) of the touchpoint “See others drinking a brand’s product”, (usually ranked in 10th–15th place)
                                    which naturally follows the trend of the hotels, restaurants and cafés sector.

                                    <h5>Off-Trade (point of sale)</h5>
                                <br />
                                    The continuity of commercial activities in the food sector has clearly benefited the contacts of this group, which
                                    practically maintained their pre-COVID-19 level of effective reach for all brands.
                                    <br><br>
                                    <h5>Digital</h5>
                                <br />
                                    The pandemic has reshaped the behaviour of consumers who, among other things, have increased their level of
                                    activity on the internet, be it to obtain information or to shop. This impact is felt even within categories of this
                                    type (food & beverages) where the importance of digital in the construction of brands was still limited compared
                                    to traditional media and on-/off-trade activities.<br><br>
                                    During the COVID-19 crisis, the digital group of contacts (detailed in Figure 1) reached second place in terms of
                                    contribution with 15%, following traditional media with 23%. This average contribution increased by 56%
                                    compared to pre-COVID-19 measurements. The two most contributive digital contacts are “Brand Website” and
                                    “Brand presence in social media” respectively responsible for 3.8% and 2.6% of the total brand experience of
                                    the category. However, overall social media remained low in influence for shoppers for the non-alcoholic drinks’
                                    category.<br><br>
                                    It would likely be insightful to undertake further tracking in the near term to detect the effect of Coca-Cola and
                                    other major brands pulling out from social media advertising.<sup>2</sup>

                                    <h5>Sponsorship</h5>
                                <br />
                                    Sports sponsorship of non-alcoholic drinks continued to deliver effective reach despite the suspensions of live
                                    events, reflecting carry-over effects as well as the impact of ‘rewind’ sports documentaries aired on TV
                                    channels. These activities are often developed consistently by brands over several years and/or sporting
                                    seasons and end up constituting durable assets as an engagement generator. The reach of all other
                                    sponsorship activities was low.

                                    <h5>Sustainability</h5>
                                <br />
                                    All five touchpoints supporting sustainability credentials were high in influence. However, few brands are yet
                                    leveraging their sustainability credentials at scale.

                                    The uncertainties caused by the pandemic underline the necessity to measure holistically and regularly.

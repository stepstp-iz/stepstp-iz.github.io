                    All personally-identifiable data provided by individuals is maintained in strict confidence by BXG and will be treated with the same level of respect and care that BXG treats its other proprietary information and trade secrets. There are instances, however, in which personally-identifiable and non-personally identifiable information is shared with third-parties, as described below. 
   					<br />
                    The non-personally identifiable data may be shared with third-party partners of BXG on an anonymous basis. 
   					<br />
                    With respect to personally-identifiable information, BXG may, from time to time, provide information to certain third-party administrative vendors for efficiency purposes in providing administrative services such as billing, delivery and pay-outs, or for other services related to providing a BXG product or service. Any third-party vendor so used will be required to enter into a confidentiality and non-disclosure agreement with BXG upon terms and conditions consistent with the policies set forth herein. 
   					<br />
                    BXG may also share personally-identifiable information with third-parties who enter into business relationships with us. These business partners may include financial service providers (including credit bureaus and insurance agents); non-financial companies (including retailers, online and offline advertisers, membership list vendors, direct marketers and publishers); companies that perform marketing services on our behalf, and others such as non-profit organizations. We may also disclose information to a third-party who provides substantially similar services as the original service signed up for, if we decide to stop providing such services ourselves. In such situations, we will provide our subscribers with an opportunity to opt-out of such sharing. Please be aware that BXG is very careful about which companies it does business with.
   					<br />
                    In addition to the above, there is also the possibility that BXG, or part(s) of the company, may one day be purchased by, or merged with, another company. If that's the case, the acquiring (or merging) company will have access to your information.
   					<br />
                    Finally, BXG may share information on individuals as it deems necessary to comply and cooperate with government and law enforcement officials.

                    BXG has a strict internal security policy with respect to the confidentiality of customer and other data, limiting access only to those employees who have a need to know such information for the purpose of effectively delivering BXG's products and services. Please keep in mind, however, that the Internet is not a 100% secure medium.

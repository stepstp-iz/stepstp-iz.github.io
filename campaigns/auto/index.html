				<p class="focus">Dear {Contact.firstName},</p>
				<br>
				<p style="text-align:justify;">Hope you are doing well in these unusual times and that the business is able to rise to both the new challenges and the fresh opportunities we face.</p>
				<p style="text-align:justify;">The world is changing, and the recent events across the world have increased the pace of change. With growing concerns about climate change and environmental degradation, sustainability has become a strategic priority for automotive organizations. Governments, consumers, and investors are continuously pushing automotive organizations to innovate and create more sustainable ways to deliver mobility.</p>
				<p style="text-align:justify;">Today, more than ever before, automotive leaders have a unique opportunity to renew the bonds between vehicle users and OEMs in a way that addresses the societal, environmental and economic issues we face, transform business models and create value sustainably.</p>
				<p style="text-align:justify;">And it’s not just about doing good, it’s about the creation of inherently sustainable and resilient business models of shared value and brand capital creation that will endure because they make sense on every dimension: social contribution; environmental impact; employee engagement; consumer choice; and financial results.</p>
				<p style="text-align:justify;">In this context, The BXG team has published a manifesto on <a class="focus" href="https://brandexperience-group.com/papers/manifesto.pdf" target="_empty">Building Enterprise Value through Sustainable Brands</a>, and it isn’t just fine words. We enable businesses to understand how customers respond to brand purpose beyond the promise and how engagement with authentic brand narratives translates into brand sustainability dividends and deficits.  Our studies suggest that the share and financial impact for brands that build relevance in this way can be very large.</p>
				<p style="text-align:justify;">
					We would like to hear from you.  Please let us know if you like to know more about:
